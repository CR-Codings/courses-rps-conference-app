# RPS Conference App code 

##NOTE: If you are using version 2.3 of NativeScript, use the ```update_2.3.0``` branch

This is a companion app to my Pluralsight course Building Cross Platform Native Mobile Applications with NativeScript.
This app is based on the [TelerikNEXT app](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-TelerikNEXT/) sample with a few things added.

Fork/clone the repository and run ```tns install``` in the rps-conf directory. 
This app is based on the Telerik NEXT app sample with a few things added.

Use this application to find-out how to implement common mobile scenarios with NativeScript.

## Running the sample

1. Make sure you have the [NativeScript Command Line Interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript) installed as well as all the prerequisites for the NativeScript development.

2. Fork and/or clone the repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/alexziskind1/courses-rps-conference-app.git
  cd courses-rps-conference-app/rps-conf
  ```
3. Install the dependencies
  ```
  tns install
  ```

4. Run the project:

    `tns run ios|android [--emulator]`

    The `--emulator` keyword instructs the CLI to load the iOS simulator or an android emulator depending on the platform you want.
